# Purpose of the project

The **main purpose** of this project is to record my experience and share it with future generations and friends of mine who would like to get familiar with [VPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server), CI/CD and other interesting staff. 

I want to concentrate on services and instruments that I used along the way and how I used them.

The main focus will be on:
- [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) and Dockerization: how to build and push containers from Github to Docker Hub automatically via straightforward CI pipeline
- [Yandex Cloud](https://cloud.yandex.com/en-ru/) service and it's virtual private servers
- Essential [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) skills: how to pull a Docker image from Docker Hub, how to start a Docker Container, and how to observe changes of the image on a server and preserve containers up-to-date all the time.

> Noticeable mention: I am not a professional DevOps engineer, Python developer and so on. I do not want to show off for someone, I just want to share useful knowledge.
